# Python Challenge

## Using Python scripting skills in a real-world situation

This activity involves two challenges- PyBank(budget data) and PyPoll(election data)

### Getting Ready:
* Create a new repository for this project
* Clone the new repository to your computer
* Inside your local git repository, create a directory for each Python Challenge- PyBank and PyPoll
* Inside of each folder, add the following:
    * a python file to contain script, Resources folder to contain CSV file, and Analysis folder to contain the analysed data

## PyBank

Create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. You will be provided with a     dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset consists of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

* Create the script that analyzes the records to calculate-
    * The total number of months included in the dataset
    * The net total amount of “Profit/Losses” over the entire period
    * The changes in “Profit/Losses” over the entire period, and the average of those changes
    * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Print and store the analysis results

## PyPoll

In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. You are provided with a dataset called election_data.csv. The dataset consists of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

* Create the script that analyzes the votes to calculate-
    * Total number of votes cast
    * List of candidate names
    * Percentage of votes each candidate won
    * Total number of votes each candidate won
    * Winner of the election

Print and store the analysis results

PS. Election dataset election_data.csv is a large file, and is unable to load from local computer. The screenshot of dataset is added to Resources folder for the reference.
