# Python Challenge

This activity involves two challenges- PyBank (budget data) and PyPoll (election data)

## PyBank

Create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. You will be provided with a dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset consists of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

* Create the script that analyzes the records to calculate -
    * The total number of months included in the dataset
    * The net total amount of “Profit/Losses” over the entire period
    * The changes in “Profit/Losses” over the entire period, and the average of those changes
    * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Print and store the analysis results

## PyPoll

In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. You are provided with a dataset called election_data.csv. The dataset consists of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

* Create the script that analyzes the votes to calculate -
    * Total number of votes cast
    * List of candidate names
    * Percentage of votes each candidate won
    * Total number of votes each candidate won
    * Winner of the election

* Print and store the analysis results

Since the election dataset election_data.csv is a large file, and is unable to upload from local computer, the screenshot of dataset is added to 'Resources' folder for the reference.
